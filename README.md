  <h2>About Me!</h2>
    <p>Hi there!</p>
    <br>
    <img src="https://github.com/kthewerewolf/Projects/assets/157539771/bcbe6ada-0c7e-4415-82b5-10122a4d9b9c" width="250" height="200"/>
    <br>
    <p>My name is Kenkaid, though I prefer Kaid, I am 30 years old and a former Business student studying organizational management at Purdue University. Life happened and I discovered I needed a major change in my life.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I had been interested in coding in High School but at the time there wasn't much open source or affordable options to learn it. That has fortunately changed!</p>
    <br>
    <p>The projects contained in this repository will be the combination of practice projects,     challenges and tweaks of curated projects from Codecademy while I am learning and <em>developing</em> my style (haha get it?) I should also mention I have a terrible sense of humor!</p>
    <br>
